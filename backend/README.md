# Backend Development for Web Analysis App

## Overview
The backend of the Web Analysis App is built using **Python** with the **Django** or **Flask** framework. It handles user authentication, site audits, keyword research, and traffic analytics. PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, with Redis for caching.

---

## Features to Implement (MVP)

### 1. User Authentication
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** for login and registration.
- Secure endpoints for authenticated users only.

### 2. Site Audits
- Implement site audit logic using **Puppeteer** (Node.js) or **Lighthouse API** via API requests.
- Return audit results in JSON format (SEO issues, page speed, broken links, etc.).

### 3. Keyword Research
- Integrate with a keyword data API (e.g., **Google Ads API**) to fetch keyword search volume, competition data, and suggestions.
- Build endpoints to serve the keyword research results to the frontend.

### 4. Traffic Analytics
- Integrate with the **Google Analytics API** to retrieve traffic data for authenticated users.
- Implement **Redis** for caching frequent data requests to optimize performance.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Python (Django or Flask)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer or Lighthouse API (via API calls)
- **APIs**: Google Analytics API, Google Ads API, Ahrefs API (optional)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Project Structure
```bash
src/
│── app/
│   │── auth/        # User authentication and management
│   │── audit/       # Site audit logic and API endpoints
│   │── keyword/     # Keyword research API integration
│   │── analytics/   # Traffic analytics logic and API endpoints
│── config.py
│── app.py
```
This structure separates the application logic into distinct modules for authentication, site audits, keyword research, and traffic analytics. The `config.py` file will contain database and API credentials, while `app.py` file will handle the main application logic and routing.

## Setup Instructions
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/web-analysis-app.git
cd web-analysis-app/backend
```
### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
For Flask:

```bash
pip install flask flask-restful flask-jwt-extended psycopg2-binary redis
```

### Configure Environment Variables
Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_KEY=your_api_key
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
```

---

### Run Database Migrations

For Flask (using Alembic for migrations):

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Running the Development Server

For Flask:

```bash
flask run
```

---

## API Documentation
### 1. User Authentication
- POST ```/api/auth/signup```: Register a new user.
- POST ```/api/auth/login```: Log in and get a JWT token.
### 2. Site Audits
- POST ```/api/audit```: Submit a URL for an SEO audit.
### 3. Keyword Research
- GET ```/api/keywords```: Search for keywords and get data.
### 4. Traffic Analytics
- GET ```/api/analytics```: Get traffic data from Google Analytics.

---

## Testing the API
- Test the API endpoints using the test suite.
- Use a testing library like Pytest to write and run tests.

For Flask:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## Deployment Instructions
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
- Configure the environment variables for the application.
- Set up a database and configure the application to use it.
- Use a WSGI server like Gunicorn to run the application.

### Using Docker
Create a ```Dockerfile``` and ```docker-compose.yml``` for easier deployment.

```dockerfile
# Example for Flask
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

### Cloud Hosting
- Deploy the backend to a cloud platform such as AWS EC2, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
- Ensure environment variables (API keys, database URL, etc.) are securely stored in cloud configurations.
- Configure the application to use the cloud-hosted database.
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
